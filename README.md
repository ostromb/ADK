Advanced and Basic Heuristic that solves the role-casting problem. Role-casting problem: Given a r number of roles each actor can play, s number of scenes and k number of actors,two of which are diva actors; find a suitable solution so that no actor has more than one role in every scene, the two diva actors never share a secene together, and solve this with as few actors as possible. If no possible placement, we have k+n superactors, that can play any role, but adds cost of k+n to amount of actors (we want to use as few as possible superactors, since having only one superactor is worse than placing out ALL actors.)
